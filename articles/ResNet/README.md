### Residual Networks (ResNet)

---
Deep neural networks have proven highly effective in handling large datasets. Models such as AlexNet and VGG have achieved remarkable success in image classification tasks involving vast amounts of data. However, these deep architectures often suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, where gradients diminish as they propagate through the network. This issue becomes more pronounced with increasing depth, causing the model to converge poorly and leading to suboptimal performance and overfitting.

Residual Networks (ResNet) were introduced to address this challenge. ResNet employs an innovative approach that enables the training of extremely deep networks by alleviating the vanishing gradient problem. The key idea behind ResNet is the use of residual connections, also known as shortcuts, which allow the model to learn the residuals (differences) between the input and output of each layer, rather than learning the transformation directly.

The residual connection can be mathematically expressed as:
$$[ F(x) + x ]$$
where $F(x)$ represents the output of the residual function (the transformation applied by the layer) and $x$ is the input to the layer. This connection helps to preserve the gradient flow during backpropagation, facilitating the training of much deeper networks.

### Components of ResNet

To implement ResNet, we need to understand the two primary building blocks: the traditional residual block and the bottleneck block.

#### Traditional Residual Block
The traditional residual block is typically used in smaller ResNet architectures, such as ResNet-18 and ResNet-34. It consists of two convolutional layers, each followed by batch normalization and a ReLU activation function. A shortcut connection bypasses these layers and adds the input directly to the output.

#### Bottleneck Block
For larger ResNet architectures, such as ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and beyond, the bottleneck block is utilized. The bottleneck block is designed to reduce the number of parameters and computational resources required to train these deep networks. It consists of three convolutional layers: a 1x1 convolution for reducing dimensionality, a 3x3 convolution, and another 1x1 convolution for restoring dimensionality. This configuration helps in maintaining computational efficiency while enabling the network to learn complex representations.
